1.Please note these points on the task:
2.i used deepl library to translate the text in the articles, so i hv removed my personal api key which was used in the variable in Translator class.
3.also couldnt complete my testing in browserstack for all 5 threads since all my 100 mins free time was over as part of initial trial account
4.otherwise i tested in one browser without running on browserstack and this executed fine. 
5.I have attached log file which i ran for 1 test.
6.Removed my browserstack key and creds as well since it is a public repo.
