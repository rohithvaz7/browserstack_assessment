Please note these points on the task:
i used deepl library to translate the text in the articles, so i hv removed my personal api key which was used in the variable in Translator class.
also couldnt complete my testing in browserstack since all my 100 mins free time was over as part of initial trial account
otherwise i tested in one browser without running on browserstack and this executed fine. I have attached log file which i ran for 1 test.
Removed my browserstack key and creds as well since it is a public repo.
